# Java-Encryption-Tool
## Overview
This is a Java-based encryption tool that utilizes a character substitution cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages. The program allows users to generate a new encryption key, get the current key, encrypt and decrypt messages, and save/load the encryption key from a file.

## Usage
1. **Generate New Key**: Run the program and choose the option to generate a new key (`N`).
2. **Get Key**: Display the current key by selecting `G`.
3. **Encrypt**: Choose `E` and enter the message you want to encrypt.
4. **Decrypt**: Choose `D` and enter the encrypted message to decrypt.
5. **Save Key**: Save the current key to a file by choosing `S`.
6. **Load Key**: Load a previously saved key from a file by selecting `L`.
7. **Quit**: Exit the program by selecting `Q`.
